* Milhouse's Scheme interpreter.

This repository contains my modified study version of the scheme interpreter
described in the wikibook [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours]['Write yourself a scheme in 48 - An introduction to
Haskell through example'.]]

My expectation here is to understand a bit more of Haskell and it's ecosystem
while contemplating the simple, beautiful and powerful Lisp.

Probably should post about this on my blog someday.
